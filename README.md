# Feedback-form

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of your feedback form code and its functionality that you can paste into a README file. This will help others understand how it works, the purpose of each section, and how the form operates in both the backend and frontend.

# Feedback Form Application
This feedback form allows users to submit feedback that is sent via email and saved to a Google Sheets document. The form uses Node.js with Express for the backend server, Nodemailer to send email notifications, and Axios to save data to Google Sheets. A Google Apps Script URL is used to handle Google Sheets data transfer.

# Setup Instructions
1. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then install the required npm packages:

  # npm install express nodemailer body-parser axios
2. Configure the Backend Server
The server.js file (or the main server file) creates an Express server with a POST endpoint at /submit-feedback:

Dependencies: The code imports express, nodemailer, body-parser, and axios.
Environment Variables: The app listens on PORT 3000, but you can set this in the .env file.
Nodemailer Transporter: Configures Nodemailer to use Gmail to send emails. Make sure to replace the user and pass fields with your email and an App Password from Gmail.
POST Endpoint: Defines /submit-feedback to handle feedback submissions.
Parses incoming JSON data to get name, email, and feedback from the request.
Uses Nodemailer to send an email with this data.
Uses Axios to post data to Google Sheets via a Google Apps Script web app URL.

3. Running the Server

To run the server:

  # node server.js
The server listens on port 3000 by default.
